# Dump-To-Clipboard
## Quick overview
This project was made so that I could copy data from a file.
## How do I use this?
### Installation
1. Download the file from releases or compile it yourself.
2. Put the folder with the executable somewhere that you think is right.
3. Add the executable's path to your system `PATH`.
>**Note:**
>If you are using the windows installer, the exe file can be found in `ProgramFiles>dtcp`
### How do I run it?
1. Open the terminal.
2. Run the command: `dtcp -h`
3. If it ran, that means you did it! Now, learn from the help text that was outputed to your terminal!
4. If it didn't run, reboot your computer. If it didn't work even after that, check if you installed it properly. (*Post an issue if you feel like it's an issue with the software!*)
## Dependencies:
